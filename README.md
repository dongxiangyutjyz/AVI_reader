This video player allows the user to open files with extension '.avi' and play the video at different rates, forward or backward. This video player also allows users to open a '.mat' file and modify the data within it in the video player. This video player is specifically built for a data set I used for a summer research lab. Users can modify the file name in avi_reader.m. I have included the .mat files in the repository, so the user can download it with the video player to try out the function of modifying data. Users are also given the flexibility to cache or undo when modifying data from a '.mat' file.
